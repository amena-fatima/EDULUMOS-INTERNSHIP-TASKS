# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns related to passenger survival.

## 📊 Objectives
- Handle missing values
- Analyze survival patterns
- Study feature relationships
- Visualize data using graphs

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Filled missing values in Age using median
- Filled missing Embarked values using mode
- Dropped Cabin column due to excessive missing values

## 📈 Visualizations
- Survival count plot
- Survival rate by gender
- Survival rate by passenger class
- Age distribution histogram
- Fare vs Survival box plot
- Correlation heatmap

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Females had higher survival rates than males
- First-class passengers survived more
- Higher fare increased survival probability

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
This project strengthened skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization.
